Pipe Intel & Privacy


Pipe Intel is designed to collect minimal information and protect the collected data.

Protecting the privacy and security of your information is a priority for us. We work hard to collect only the data we need to make your experience smooth. When we do collect data, we believe it’s important you know what we’re collecting and why we need it so that you can make informed choices. Pipe Intel is designed with these principles in mind.

To improve Pipe Intel, we collect information about the app performance and your interactions with the app. The data is associated with an identifier specific to Pipe Intel. Unless you need to access the data for download, we only use the device identifier to associate your interactions with the app. If you are downloading data using the utility available in the app, we save your email id in the database and associate it with the specific data you have downloaded. This would ensure that when you visit the app to download next time, you will be able to access the same configuration. At this time, we do not have the ability to forget/delete your information. As the application evolves, we may be able to invest in adding a capability that would let you delete all the information yourself. However, until that time, we have made this process available on the front end of the Contact Us page on the website and the Feedback page in the application. You are welcome to contact us requesting the deletion of your personal information. When you contact us, please include the device ID and the email address you used so we can look up, filter the database for your information, and delete all associated records.  

Content such as news articles, tweets, and stock prices are collected from third parties. Please note that when you select a link that takes you to the source site which resides outside Pipe Intel, we no longer have control over what data is collected and how it is managed as the privacy policies for the site you visit get applied.
